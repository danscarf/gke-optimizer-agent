# GKE Resource Optimizer: Security & Reliability TODO List

This document tracks planned security and reliability enhancements for the GKE Resource Optimizer project. Items are organized by priority and estimated complexity.

## High Priority

- [ ] **Add basic input validation for resource values**  
  _Complexity: Low_  
  Validate CPU and memory input values against regex patterns to prevent injection attacks.

- [ ] **Implement basic unit tests**  
  _Complexity: Medium_  
  Add pytest tests for core functionality, especially the resource validation logic.

- [ ] **Add request logging**  
  _Complexity: Low_  
  Log all requests and responses with appropriate detail for debugging and auditing.

- [ ] **Validate Slack request signatures**  
  _Complexity: Low_  
  Ensure all incoming Slack requests have valid signatures before processing.

- [ ] **Add health check endpoint with deeper service checks**  
  _Complexity: Low_  
  Enhance the health check to verify connectivity to all dependent services.

## Medium Priority

- [ ] **Set up CI/CD pipeline**  
  _Complexity: Medium_  
  Implement automated testing and deployment pipeline with GitHub Actions or similar.

- [ ] **Implement better secret management**  
  _Complexity: Medium_  
  Move from environment variables to a proper secret management solution.

- [ ] **Add monitoring and alerting**  
  _Complexity: Medium_  
  Set up basic monitoring for application health and error rates.

- [ ] **Implement error retries**  
  _Complexity: Low_  
  Add retry logic with exponential backoff for external API calls.

- [ ] **Add audit logging**  
  _Complexity: Medium_  
  Log all resource modifications with user identity, timestamp, and changes.

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] **Implement RBAC**  
  _Complexity: High_  
  Add role-based access control for different user types.

- [ ] **Add dependency scanning**  
  _Complexity: Low_  
  Scan dependencies for security vulnerabilities regularly.

- [ ] **Implement approval workflows**  
  _Complexity: High_  
  Add approval requirements for significant resource changes.

- [ ] **Set up blue/green deployments**  
  _Complexity: High_  
  Implement zero-downtime deployment strategy.

- [ ] **Add integration tests**  
  _Complexity: High_  
  Create comprehensive integration tests for all external services.

## Notes

- This list should be reviewed and updated regularly
- Start with high-priority items before moving to medium-priority ones
- Consider security implications of each feature during development
- Document all security-related changes
